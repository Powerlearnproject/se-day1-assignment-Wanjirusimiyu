#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. It involves the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software products. 
Its Importance is that it helps in creating modern solutions to real world problems and creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The development of programming languages.
The establishment of software engineering as a principle in the 1960.
The advent of structured programming in the 1970.
The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements: This is gathering and documenting the user's needs and the system requirements.

Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the system architecture and the user interface.

Implementing: Writing code to bring the idea to life and ensure it meets the design specifications.

Testing: Conduct various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.

Deployment: Publishing the code to ensure its available to all users.

Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.




Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall Methodologies: This is the sequential approach of software development. This includes: Design, implementation, testing, etc.

Agile Methodologies: This is the iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change.
Here there are scrums that emphasize small, self-organizing teams working in short iterations called sprints.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager:  Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments : Software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code (e.g., Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).
Version Control Systems : Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members (e.g., Git, Subversion)

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.

Strategies to Overcome: 
Effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

Importance of Quality Control: Quality control measures such as code reviews, automated testing, and continuous integration help identify and fix defects early in the development process, leading to higher-quality software products.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. 
Importance: helps avoid vagueness by making your questions clear and specific, so the AI understands exactly what you need.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: Tell me about cats.
Clear and concise prompt: Tell me about the history of domestic cats.
